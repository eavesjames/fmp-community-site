      "insight": "The NEC Article 726→722 renumbering creates a 2–3 year window of simultaneous compliance environments — jurisdictions on 2020, 2023, and 2026 NEC will reference different article numbers for identical Class 4 technology. For contractors, this means bid documents and permit applications need to reference dual article numbers until the 2026 NEC is widely adopted. For AHJs, it means inspectors unfamiliar with the safety model may flag legitimate installs. A single AHJ-facing reference document mapping all three article numbers to the same safety model would reduce friction across all jurisdictions.",

Finance teams approving AI hardware deployments are inadvertently committing to UPS and distribution upgrades that have not been budgeted in the facilities plan. This creates a predictable budget conflict in 2026–2027 as the first wave of AI infrastructure deployments hits facilities limits.",

Building owners who have not started planning by Q3 2026 are implicitly choosing to pay penalties, not from a deliberate decision but from timeline math. FMP's ability to route through existing risers and avoid service upgrades is not just a cost advantage — it is increasingly the only path to LL97 compliance for late-starting projects.",

But the MEP analyst's point about specification language and the contractor's point about permit friction suggest the real bottleneck is not economics — it's that the specification and permitting infrastructure for FMP in NYC is not yet mature enough to absorb a surge in demand if owners do start moving before 2028. The economic case is becoming clear; the execution infrastructure to fulfill it is the constraint.",
  "analyst_disagreements": [
    "The finance analyst saw Cence Power's entry primarily as a competitive pricing event (more OEMs = lower costs). The compliance analyst saw it primarily as a standards coordination challenge (CSA working group timeline uncertainty). Both are right, but the near-term impact is the compliance uncertainty, not the pricing effect — pricing only matters if the install can get permitted.",
    "The installer and MEP analysts disagreed implicitly on the Article 726→722 impact timeline. The installer emphasized near-term bid friction; the MEP emphasized longer-term specification language updates. Both are real, but on different timescales — the installer's friction is immediate in jurisdictions adopting 2026 NEC, while the MEP's specification update is a 2–3 year project management task."
