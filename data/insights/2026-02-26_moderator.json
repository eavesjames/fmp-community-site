For contractors, bid documents and permit applications need to reference dual article numbers until 2026 NEC is widely adopted. For AHJs, inspectors unfamiliar with the safety model may flag legitimate installs. A single AHJ-facing reference document mapping all three article numbers to the same safety model would reduce friction across all jurisdictions.",
      "why_it_is_new": "Prior Pulse coverage noted the code recognition milestone. This insight focuses on the transition-window friction — a near-term operational problem for contractors and AHJs that precedes the long-term adoption benefit.",
      "new_perspective_from_disagreement": "The installer analyst emphasized near-term bid friction; the compliance analyst emphasized the AHJ documentation gap; the MEP analyst noted the downstream impact on specification language. All three are real, on different timescales — but the installer's permit friction is the immediate blocker.",

Finance teams approving AI hardware deployments are inadvertently committing to UPS and distribution upgrades that have not been budgeted in the facilities plan. This creates a predictable budget conflict in 2026–2027 as the first wave of AI infrastructure deployments hits facilities limits.",
      "why_it_is_new": "Coverage of AI power density has focused on the trend (density is rising) rather than the organizational and budget mechanism through which the upgrade cost surfaces. The insight is that the conflict is structurally predictable, not accidental.",
      "new_perspective_from_disagreement": "The finance analyst saw the density problem as a ROI timing mismatch (capex committed now, cost realized later). The MEP analyst saw it as a specification gap. The owner-operator analyst saw it as a governance problem (IT buys, facilities pays).

The FMP Alliance should consider publishing an independent cost-per-kW benchmarking framework that allows buyers to evaluate OEM options without requiring direct vendor disclosure.",
      "why_it_is_new": "Market entries by new OEMs are typically covered as positive signals. This insight reframes it: competition without price transparency shifts negotiating leverage to informed buyers while leaving uninformed buyers with no reference point.",

Building owners who have not started planning by Q3 2026 are implicitly choosing to pay penalties — not from a deliberate decision but from timeline math. FMP's ability to route through existing risers and avoid service upgrades is not just a cost advantage — it is increasingly the only viable path to LL97 compliance for late-starting projects.",

The finance analyst noted that the penalty avoidance calculation (penalty cost vs. retrofit cost) becomes compelling only when traditional pathway costs are included.
