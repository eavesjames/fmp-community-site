As VRLA batteries age, rising internal resistance drives up float current, which dissipates as heat inside the UPS enclosure and must be removed by facility cooling (item 57). In an AI facility already operating near cooling capacity limits due to 33% higher rack density (item 51), the incremental cooling load from degraded batteries is not an isolated maintenance variable \u2014 it competes with compute cooling budget, can tip thermal margins, and increases chiller operating cost before any runtime failure event is observable.

The synthesis is that neither approach alone is sufficient in AI facilities already at cooling capacity limits: overprovisioning cooling capacity is constrained by facility architecture (item 53), and monitoring only detects the problem after the cooling competition is already occurring.

      "why_this_will_improve_insights": "INS-003 and the rank-2 article angle depend on a quantified relationship between setpoint policy and float-current cooling load increase. Item 57 establishes the mechanism qualitatively but provides no numbers. Measured float current data by temperature and aging stage would allow practitioners to calculate the net energy impact of setpoint decisions \u2014 currently the missing evidence that prevents this from being a decision-changing insight rather than a directional hypothesis."

None of the Pulse items provide actual inspection data \u2014 all evidence is inferential. Finding real permit data (review times, resubmittal rates, rejection reasons) or a NFPA/UL publication timeline for Class 4 guidance would either confirm the deployment bottleneck hypothesis and justify the unified standards article angle, or reveal that AHJ acceptance is faster than analysts assumed, which would shift the binding constraint back to contractor training or economic adoption."
