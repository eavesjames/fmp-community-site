title: "How FMP Is Installed: A Contractor's Overview"
description: "FMP installations follow Class 2 wiring methods — no conduit required — but the transmitter and receiver add commissioning steps that differ from traditional electrical work."
summary: "FMP uses Class 2 wiring methods: route cable through existing pathways, terminate at receivers, commission the transmitter. The main new steps are AHJ documentation and transmitter setup."

## System components

An FMP installation has three parts:

1. **Transmitter** — connects to the building electrical panel; manages fault monitoring and power output; installed by a licensed electrician
2. **FMP cable** — standard low-voltage cable routed through the building using Class 2 methods
3. **Receiver** — converts FMP output to usable AC or DC for the connected load (heat pump, lighting, rack equipment)

## Wiring and routing

- Uses standard low-voltage cable — no conduit required, no junction boxes along the run
- Cannot be mixed in the same conduit as line-voltage wiring
- **Routing options in retrofits:** abandoned steam risers, laundry chutes, mail chutes, plenum spaces, conduit fill alongside low-voltage data cables, ceiling cavities
- In NYC multifamily retrofits, abandoned risers are the primary pathway — no new penetrations required in most cases

## What requires a licensed electrician

- Panel connection at the transmitter input
- Any line-voltage connection at the load (e.g., heat pump disconnect, panel feed)
- Permit application and AHJ submission in most jurisdictions

## Commissioning steps specific to FMP

These steps are additional to standard low-voltage installation:

1. Set transmitter output parameters (voltage, max current, zone configuration) per manufacturer specs
2. Run the transmitter's commissioning check — the unit validates the cable and receiver before going live
3. Document UL listing numbers, cable lengths, and connected load specs for the AHJ package
4. First-run AHJ inspection: budget 30–60 minutes for a walkthrough in jurisdictions unfamiliar with Class 4 — they will want to see the transmitter response to a simulated fault

## Common mistakes to avoid

- **Exceeding cable length spec**: check the manufacturer datasheet for your transmitter model; longer runs affect fault response
- **Incomplete AHJ package**: submitting without the safety model summary and UL listing causes holds in unfamiliar jurisdictions
- **Wrong article number**: cite both Article 726 (2023 NEC) and Article 722 (2026 NEC) until your AHJ's code edition is confirmed
