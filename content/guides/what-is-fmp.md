## What FMP is

Fault Managed Power is a power delivery system that continuously monitors current on every conductor and shuts down any fault within milliseconds — faster than the human nervous system can respond.

The result: safe electrical power that can be routed through standard low-voltage wiring (Class 2 rules), without conduit, without junction boxes, and without a service upgrade.

## How the safety model works

- **Conventional power** is made safe through insulation and overcurrent devices that trip in seconds
- **FMP** is made safe through continuous monitoring: the transmitter samples current 100,000× per second and limits fault energy before it reaches harmful levels
- If a fault is detected, the circuit shuts down in under 2 milliseconds — before current reaches levels that can cause shock or ignition

## NEC recognition

FMP is recognized in the National Electrical Code as **Class 4** wiring:

- **2023 NEC**: Article 726
- **2026 NEC**: Article 722 (renumbered; same safety model)

Class 4 is separate from Class 1, Class 2, and Class 3. See [NEC Class 4 / Article 726](/guides/nec-class-4-article-726/) for permit and inspection details.

## Who makes FMP systems

- **VoltServer** — "Digital Electricity," the original commercial FMP system; 1,000+ installations globally across data centers, edge, and building electrification
- **Cence Power** — Class 4 DC distribution systems for data centers and telecom
- Additional OEMs entering as NEC recognition matures

## Why it matters now

- **NYC Local Law 97** penalties begin 2030 — buildings need heat pumps, heat pumps need panel upgrades. FMP routes around the upgrade cost.
- **AI rack density** (averaging 27 kW/rack, AFCOM 2025) is pushing data centers past standard distribution limits — FMP enables new wiring pathways without conduit rerouting.
- **2026 NEC** completes the code transition that began in 2020, making permit documentation cleaner across jurisdictions.
