## Multifamily building retrofits (building electrification)

**The problem:** Heat pump retrofits in older multifamily buildings require panel and service upgrades costing $15,000–$30,000 per unit, with 18–24 month utility coordination timelines. Around 50% of retrofit projects in pre-1973 buildings are canceled because of this barrier.

**How FMP changes the equation:**

- Routes power through existing building risers (abandoned steam, laundry, mail, trash chutes)
- Avoids service upgrades entirely — no new utility service, no switchgear replacement
- Reduces power distribution costs by ~95% vs. traditional electrical upgrade
- Works in buildings with 40A panels, failing hydronic systems, and no room for new conduit runs

**NYC-specific:** 80% of NYC buildings face Local Law 97 carbon penalties by 2030. Buildings that haven't started planning by late 2026 are running out of time for traditional upgrade pathways — 18–24 month lead times close the window. FMP is increasingly the only viable path for late-starters.

## Data centers

**The problem:** AI workloads have pushed average rack density to 27 kW (AFCOM, 2025), well above the 8–15 kW assumption in most existing PDU and busway specifications. Standard distribution infrastructure can't accommodate this without major civil work.

**How FMP helps:**

- Enables new power distribution pathways without conduit rerouting or raised-floor reconfiguration
- Class 4 wiring can share trays and risers with low-voltage data cable
- Relevant for both new AI cluster rows and retrofit of existing raised-floor environments
- Reduces per-endpoint wiring cost in distributed high-density deployments

## Edge infrastructure

**The problem:** Edge sites — telecom cabinets, streetside enclosures, building IoT aggregation — need reliable power at remote locations, often in spaces not designed for traditional electrical runs.

**How FMP helps:**

- Delivers power over standard low-voltage cabling to remote endpoints
- Eliminates dedicated conduit runs to each endpoint
- Relevant for PoE-adjacent applications requiring more power than 802.3bt (90W) allows
- Single transmitter can serve multiple endpoints across a building or campus
