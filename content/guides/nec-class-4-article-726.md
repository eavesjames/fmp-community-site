title: "NEC Class 4 / Article 726: What Electricians and AHJs Need to Know"
description: "NEC Class 4 (Article 726 in the 2023 NEC; Article 722 in the 2026 NEC) is the code pathway for fault managed power systems. It is separate from Class 2 and Class 3 — different safety model, different wiring rules."
summary: "Class 4 is a distinct NEC wiring category, not a variant of Class 2. Here's what installers and inspectors need to know about permits, article numbers, and the 2026 NEC transition."

## Which article to cite

| NEC Edition | Article | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 2020 NEC | 726 (introduced) | First edition with Class 4 |
| 2023 NEC | 726 | Current edition in most jurisdictions |
| 2026 NEC | 722 (renumbered) | Same safety model; article number changed |

**During the transition:** Cite both editions in permit packages — *"Article 726 (2023 NEC) / Article 722 (2026 NEC)."* AHJs on older editions may not recognize Article 722; AHJs on 2026 NEC may not recognize Article 726 in older product documentation.

## Class 4 is not Class 2 or Class 3

- **Class 2 / Class 3** (Article 725): power-limited circuits; safety via low power output
- **Class 4** (Article 726/722): fault-managed circuits; safety via continuous real-time monitoring and fault isolation — not by limiting total power

Class 4 allows higher power delivery than Class 2 while using equivalent installation methods, because the transmitter eliminates fault energy before it can do harm.

## Wiring rules

- Follows **Class 2 installation methods**: no conduit required, standard low-voltage wire, flexible routing
- Termination at the load side does not require a licensed electrician (verify local amendments)
- Cable can run through existing pathways: abandoned risers, plenum spaces, conduit fill alongside low-voltage cables
- Cannot be mixed in the same conduit as line-voltage wiring

## AHJ documentation checklist

For first-time Class 4 submissions in a jurisdiction, include:

1. UL listing number(s) for the transmitter and receiver
2. Applicable NEC article — cite both 726 (2023) and 722 (2026) with edition years
3. Safety model summary: how fault detection works, max fault energy, response time (< 2 ms)
4. One-line diagram: panel → transmitter → cable → receiver → load
5. FMP Alliance contact (or NFPA) available for inspector questions
