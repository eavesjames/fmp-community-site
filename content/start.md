Fault Managed Power (FMP) is a wiring category in the National Electrical Code (Class 4, Article 726/722) that delivers power safely through standard low-voltage wiring by monitoring and isolating faults in milliseconds — not by limiting total power output.

This site tracks FMP's technical development, code adoption, and real-world deployment across three markets: building electrification retrofits, data centers, and edge infrastructure.
