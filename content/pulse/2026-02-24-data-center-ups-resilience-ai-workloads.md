so_what: "GPU rack densities above 40 kW are forcing data centers to rethink UPS topology — distributed, rack-level protection is replacing centralized string UPS."
summary: "AI GPU clusters are pushing rack power densities beyond 40–100 kW, breaking assumptions baked into traditional centralized UPS designs. Operators are adopting distributed power architectures with fault isolation closer to the load."

Hyperscale and colocation operators report that AI training clusters routinely exceed 40 kW per rack, with some liquid-cooled GPU configurations approaching 100 kW. Traditional N+1 string UPS systems designed around 5–10 kW average rack loads are ill-suited to this density shift.

Fault Managed Power's built-in fault isolation and distributed sensing architecture positions it as a complementary layer for edge-of-rack resilience, particularly in retrofit scenarios where rewiring entire power distribution units is impractical.
