## What it is

TierPoint discusses how AI workloads are driving data center transformation through high-density colocation, specialized rack design with enhanced cooling, and shifts to DC power delivery. The article cites that 79% of operators expect ongoing rack density increases due to AI, and notes DC power can improve efficiency by reducing conversion losses.

## Why it matters

Facilities managers face mounting pressure to deliver higher power density per rack for AI/HPC workloads, driving adoption of DC power distribution to reclaim watts lost in AC-DC conversion. The shift affects power delivery architecture decisions, cooling design, and monitoring strategies (IoT sensors for performance visibility). AFCOM data showing 79% expect continued density growth signals sustained infrastructure redesign.

**Evidence from source:**

- 79% of data center operators expect ongoing increase in rack density due to AI (AFCOM 2025 State of the Data Center Report)
- Direct current (DC) power can improve power delivery efficiency to high-density racks, freeing up power for compute hardware instead of losing it in conversion
- High-density racks require larger fans, more air vents, efficient cooling systems like liquid cooling, and more high-bandwidth fiber cabling for parallel GPU processing

## Open questions

- What specific DC voltage levels are being deployed for AI racks, and how does this affect upstream distribution and safety protocols?
- How are operators balancing modular rack deployment speed with the integration of IoT monitoring for real-time power and thermal telemetry?
