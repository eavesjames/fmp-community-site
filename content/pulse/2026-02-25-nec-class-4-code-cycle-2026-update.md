The 2026 NEC draft cycle includes revised Article 726 language covering Class 4 Fault Managed Power systems. Key changes address permissible wiring methods, co-location with other circuits, and AHJ inspection checkpoints — areas that have caused project delays when local inspectors lacked clear guidance.

The FMP Alliance submitted formal comments in the code-making process advocating for installation flexibility in existing buildings, including routing through abandoned conduit and chase paths.
