## What it is

NWS announces a free hybrid training event on February 18, 2026 with ECAO and VoltServer's Jeff Crounse covering Fault-Managed Power Systems (FMPS) and new Class 4 standards in the Electrical Code. The session will address what FMPS is, how it differs from traditional power, and practical installation and cost-saving insights for smart buildings, data centers, and telecom applications.

## Why it matters

As Class 4 standards enter the Electrical Code, contractors and AHJs need practical training on installation requirements and code compliance for FMPS deployments delivering up to 450V DC with reduced arc flash and shock risk. This event targets the knowledge gap that creates permitting friction and delays adoption in smart buildings, data centers, and telecom projects where FMPS enables longer runs with thinner cables.

**Evidence from source:**

- Training covers 'new Class 4 standards in the Electrical Code' and 'practical insights on installation and cost-saving benefits'
- FMPS delivers 'high-voltage DC (up to 450V) with the safety profile of low-voltage systems... power devices over longer distances with thinner cables'
- Target applications: 'smart buildings, data centers, and telecom'

## Open questions

- What specific Class 4 code articles or changes will the training cover for 2026 adoption cycles?
- How are Canadian jurisdictions (ECAO/Toronto) harmonizing Class 4 standards with NEC vs. CEC requirements?
