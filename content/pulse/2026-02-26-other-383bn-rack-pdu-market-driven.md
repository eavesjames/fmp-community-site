## What it is

Global rack PDU market forecast to reach $3.83B by 2031, driven by AI and HPC workloads pushing average rack densities to 12kW. Legacy data centers face technical and financial barriers retrofitting for intelligent PDUs due to inadequate cooling capacity and architectural constraints.

## Why it matters

The shift to 12kW average rack density (AFCOM 2024) and power-intensive GPU deployments render standard power infrastructure inadequate. Facilities managers must decide whether to defer costly retrofits or invest in intelligent PDUs capable of monitoring and managing heavier electrical loads, despite many older facilities lacking the cooling capacity or architectural design to support modernization.

**Evidence from source:**

- Average rack density rose to 12 kilowatts (AFCOM 2024), highlighting need for advanced units to handle intensified power profiles
- Power-intensive GPUs for generative AI training render standard power infrastructure inadequate
- Legacy data centers lack architectural design or cooling capacity for next-generation power distribution, causing operators to postpone upgrades

## Open questions

- What specific cooling capacity thresholds or architectural features are required to retrofit legacy facilities for intelligent PDUs at 12kW+ densities?
- How are operators with aging infrastructure justifying ROI for intelligent PDU upgrades when facing high modernization costs?
