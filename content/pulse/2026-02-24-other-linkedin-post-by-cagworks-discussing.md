## What it is

CAG.Works introduces fault-managed power (FMP) as the future of electrical infrastructure, emphasizing proactive safety and intelligence built into system design rather than reactive problem-solving. The post positions FMP as essential for data centers, smart buildings, and modern power distribution projects, describing it as the emerging standard for next-generation intelligent buildings.

## Why it matters

This update provides context on FMP ecosystem development and helps practitioners stay informed on industry direction.
