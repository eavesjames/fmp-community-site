## What it is

California's Energy-Smart Homes program offers incentives for whole building electrification alterations on existing single-family and low-rise multifamily properties. Requires conversion of all gas appliances to electric (heat pump HVAC, heat pump water heating, induction cooking, electric dryer) with incentives of $4,250 base plus bonuses.

## Why it matters

The explicit $1,000 electric infrastructure upgrade bonus (capped at actual cost) acknowledges that service and panel capacity upgrades are a bottleneck in residential electrification retrofits. Property owners and contractors must coordinate equipment conversion with electrical distribution upgrades to qualify, affecting project sequencing and cost structure.

**Evidence from source:**

- $4,250 base incentive for whole building electrification alterations (2025-2027), requires heat pump space heating, heat pump water heating, induction cooking, electric dryer
- $1,000 electric infrastructure upgrade bonus per unit served, capped at total costs associated with the upgrade
- Projects must apply by November 3, 2025 for 2025 incentive levels; program funds limited, first-come first-served

## Open questions

- What documentation is required to claim the electric infrastructure upgrade bonus, and does it cover service entrance, panel, or branch circuit work?
- How do first-come-first-served funding constraints affect project scheduling and pipeline management for contractors?
