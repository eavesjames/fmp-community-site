## What it is

Stok analyzes electrification feasibility for existing buildings, arguing success requires integration with capital replacement cycles rather than standalone projects. Presents case study of 480k SF San Diego campus (four buildings) needing rooftop AC and gas boiler replacement, where end-of-life timing created opportunity to evaluate electrification vs. like-for-like replacement.

## Why it matters

Owner-operators face make-or-buy decisions when aged equipment reaches end-of-life; timing capital upgrades to avoid 'layering' electrification costs affects ROI and disruption. The case study demonstrates how equipment replacement windows create natural integration points for decarbonization, but excerpt cuts off before revealing infrastructure upgrade constraints (electrical service, panel capacity, distribution) that typically drive retrofit feasibility and cost.

**Evidence from source:**

- 480,000 SF San Diego campus with four buildings, eight aged rooftop AC units at end-of-life requiring near-term capital replacement
- Campus currently served by rooftop AC for cooling and gas-fired boilers for heating, plus gas domestic hot water and commercial kitchen systems
- Article advocates integrating electrification into 'normal capital replacement cycles' and anticipating 'equipment end-of-life events' to avoid unnecessary infrastructure upgrade costs

## Open questions

- What electrical service and distribution upgrades were required for the San Diego campus electrification?
- How did the ROI compare between like-for-like gas replacement vs. heat pump electrification pathway?
