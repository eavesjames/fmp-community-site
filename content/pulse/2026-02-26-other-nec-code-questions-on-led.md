## What it is

Educational resource addressing NEC code questions electricians have about LED lighting installations. Distinguishes Class 2 and Class 3 power-limited circuits under Article 725 from the newer Class 4 category introduced specifically for fault managed power systems.

## Why it matters

Electrical contractors need to understand the distinction between traditional power-limited circuits and the new Class 4 category to correctly spec, install, and obtain approval for fault managed power deployments. The NEC's formal recognition of Class 4 as a separate category establishes a clear code pathway but requires field education on the differences from familiar Class 2/3 rules.

**Evidence from source:**

- Class 2 and Class 3 circuits remain in Article 725 and are power limited
- Class 4 is a newer category introduced for fault managed power systems

## Open questions

- What specific Article 725 requirements differ between Class 2/3 and Class 4 installations?
- How are AHJs interpreting Class 4 requirements for LED lighting projects in practice?
