## What it is

Solar Mounts LLC attended a workshop at RE+ Northeast 2026 discussing grid capacity challenges and the future need for a hybrid AC/DC 'grid of grids' infrastructure. The presentation highlighted that the NEC is adding sections on Fault-Managed Power with focus on power articulation, driven by massive new electrical demands from AI data centers, EVs, and heat pumps requiring 2-4x current grid capacity.

## Why it matters

Industry events provide networking opportunities and access to latest technical updates. Conference presentations often preview upcoming developments before formal announcements.
