description: "EnerSys analysis of how rising temps, AI power density, and cycling patterns are accelerating UPS battery aging and forcing operators to rethink VRLA refresh cycles."
summary: "EnerSys examines how modern data center operating conditions—higher ambient temps, AI workload density, shorter autonomy windows (5-15 min), and frequent cycling—are causing VRLA UPS batteries to age faster than traditional replacement schedules anticipated. The article identifies that aging batteries increase float current and cooling load, creating runtime drift and slower recharge well before scheduled replacement."

## What it is

EnerSys examines how modern data center operating conditions—higher ambient temps, AI workload density, shorter autonomy windows (5-15 min), and frequent cycling—are causing VRLA UPS batteries to age faster than traditional replacement schedules anticipated. The article identifies that aging batteries increase float current and cooling load, creating runtime drift and slower recharge well before scheduled replacement.

## Why it matters

Data center operators using calendar-based UPS battery replacement schedules face unplanned runtime shortfalls as higher temps and AI power density accelerate VRLA aging. Facilities managers must shift to condition-based replacement strategies to avoid uptime risk and control increased float current and cooling loads from degraded batteries. This affects maintenance planning, capital budgeting, and choice of battery chemistry for new deployments.

**Evidence from source:**

- Shorter autonomy windows (5–15 minutes) mean UPS batteries experience more charge/discharge events than in the past
- Even small temperature rises accelerate battery aging and reduce service life; many facilities increased setpoints to reduce cooling costs
- As batteries age, internal resistance rises, driving up float current—an overlooked contributor to energy use and cooling load

## Open questions

- What monitoring telemetry or testing protocols enable condition-based replacement vs. calendar intervals for VRLA batteries?
- How do alternative chemistries (lithium-ion, etc.) perform under the same high-temp, high-density, frequent-cycling conditions?
