## What it is

The Glendale Environmental Coalition hosted a webinar on the city's new AC2HP Reach Code, adopted Fall 2025, which requires heat pumps or AC plus efficiency upgrades when replacing/altering AC systems in single-family homes, duplexes, and townhomes. Speakers from US Green Building Council CA and Hilo Aire covered technical installation details, panel upgrade exceptions, and contractor selection.

## Why it matters

The reach code mandates heat pumps on AC replacement unless panel capacity is insufficient—surfacing panel upgrade as a key install constraint. Electrical contractors and facilities managers must evaluate existing service capacity and navigate the exception path when heat pumps require panel upgrades but AC units do not. This affects project scoping, cost estimation, and compliance pathways for residential HVAC replacements.

**Evidence from source:**

- Code applies when 'existing air conditioning system is replaced, altered, or when a new air conditioning system is installed' in single-family homes, duplexes, townhomes.
- Exception: 'If you would need a panel upgrade to install a heat pump, but not a new AC, you get an exception; however, this rarely happens because heat pumps use a similar [power draw].'
- Alternative compliance path: 'installing a new air conditioner along with specific energy-efficiency upgrades, such as duct sealing, insulation, and system performance improvements.'

## Open questions

- What percentage of Glendale homes trigger the panel upgrade exception, and how does that affect heat pump adoption rates?
- Are there preemptive panel upgrade incentives bundled with the heat pump rebates to remove this bottleneck?
