## What it is

Minnesota state-certified CE class for Power Limited Technicians (PLT) and electrical professionals covers 2026 NEC reorganization of Chapter 7 limited-energy cabling. Article 722 now consolidates rules for Class 2/3/4, fire alarm, comms, optical fiber, and broadband circuits previously scattered across Articles 723-726, with new compliance requirements and interaction rules.

## Why it matters

Power Limited Technicians and electrical contractors must navigate a major NEC reorganization affecting how low-voltage systems (fire alarm, access control, comms, PoE) are installed and inspected. The consolidation into Article 722 changes code references, fastening/support requirements (Article 300.11), and interaction between power-limited and limited-energy circuits, directly impacting permit approval, AHJ interpretation, and installation practices for edge/security integrators.

**Evidence from source:**

- 2026 NEC Article 722 consolidates limited-energy cables from Articles 723, 724, 725, 726 covering Class 2/3/4, fire alarm, comms, optical fiber, and broadband circuits
- Course addresses 'new compliance considerations' and Article 300.11 securing/supporting rules inspectors enforce for workmanlike installations
- Designed for Power Limited Technicians (PLT), electricians who install/maintain low-voltage and limited-energy systems

## Open questions

- What specific compliance gaps emerge when existing installations reference pre-2026 article numbers (723-726)?
- How does Article 722 change securing/support requirements for mixed low-voltage pathways in retrofit scenarios?
