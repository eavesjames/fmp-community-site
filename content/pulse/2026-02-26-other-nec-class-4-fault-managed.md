## What it is

Educational content addressing common NEC code questions electricians encounter when installing LED lighting. Includes discussion of Class 4 fault managed power systems, described as a newer code category for high-power, low-voltage distribution often associated with certain PoE applications.

## Why it matters

Electricians and contractors need clarity on how Class 4 classification applies to fault managed power and PoE installations. The NEC code guidance affects how they design, specify, and install LED lighting systems using these distribution methods, particularly determining what pathways and safety requirements apply.

**Evidence from source:**

- Class 4 is described as a newer category introduced for fault managed power systems
- These systems are characterized as high power but low voltage
- Class 4 is associated with certain PoE applications
