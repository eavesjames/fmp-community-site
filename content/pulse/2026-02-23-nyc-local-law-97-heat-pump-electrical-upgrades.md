so_what: "NYC pre-war buildings face LL97 fines, but panel upgrades at $15K–$30K/unit cause owners to delay heat pump retrofits — exactly the gap FMP eliminates."
summary: "Local Law 97 carbon penalty enforcement is accelerating, but electrical infrastructure costs remain the primary barrier blocking heat pump adoption in pre-war multifamily buildings. Fault Managed Power offers a pathway that avoids full panel upgrades."

New York City's Local Law 97 imposes escalating carbon penalties on large buildings starting in 2025, with fines reaching $268/ton of CO₂ above thresholds. For pre-war multifamily buildings with aging 40-amp panels, the path to heat pump electrification requires electrical service upgrades estimated at $15,000–$30,000 per unit — costs that make ROI calculations negative for most owners.

Fault Managed Power (Class 4) wiring can deliver sufficient power for heat pumps and other HVAC loads through existing building pathways — abandoned risers, conduit, and low-voltage chases — without requiring panel replacement or utility service upgrades, cutting the electrical barrier by up to 95%.
