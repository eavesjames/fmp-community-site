description: "HVAC contractor checklist covering dedicated circuits, breaker sizing via MCA/MOCP labels, panel capacity requirements, and weatherproof disconnects for heat pump installs."
summary: "HVAC contractor guide outlining electrical prerequisites for heat pump installation: dedicated circuits, correct breaker sizing based on manufacturer MCA/MOCP ratings, sufficient panel capacity with two open slots, and weatherproof disconnect requirements. Emphasizes that most installation delays stem from inadequate panel capacity, incorrect breaker sizing, or old wiring rather than equipment issues."

## What it is

HVAC contractor guide outlining electrical prerequisites for heat pump installation: dedicated circuits, correct breaker sizing based on manufacturer MCA/MOCP ratings, sufficient panel capacity with two open slots, and weatherproof disconnect requirements. Emphasizes that most installation delays stem from inadequate panel capacity, incorrect breaker sizing, or old wiring rather than equipment issues.

## Why it matters

Electrical contractors and HVAC installers face installation delays and failed inspections when residential panels lack capacity or open breaker slots for heat pump loads, especially units with electric backup strips requiring separate high-amperage breakers. The excerpt identifies panel upgrades and breaker sizing (via MCA/MOCP labels) as common bottlenecks that must be resolved before equipment commissioning, directly affecting project schedules and coordination between trades.

**Evidence from source:**

- Heat pump requires dedicated circuit, correct breaker size from manufacturer's MCA and MOCP numbers, and panel must have two open slots for new breaker
- Units with electric backup strips demand higher amperage and may require separate breakers
- Weatherproof safety disconnect required near outdoor unit for safe servicing and inspections

## Open questions

- What is the typical timeline and cost delta when a heat pump retrofit triggers a residential panel upgrade?
- How do inverter vs. single-stage heat pumps compare in their impact on required breaker sizing and panel load calculations?
