description: "Markham-based Cence Power introduces Class 4 DC distribution for data centers and telecom, reducing copper requirements and enabling safer high-voltage DC delivery."
summary: "Cence Power has launched Canada's first Class 4 fault-managed DC power distribution system, targeting data centers and telecom. The system delivers roughly 10x voltage (vs. 48V DC) in cables 1/10th the thickness, reducing copper use, construction costs, and carbon footprint while adding fault detection that disables power before shock/fire hazards injure technicians."

## What it is

Cence Power has launched Canada's first Class 4 fault-managed DC power distribution system, targeting data centers and telecom. The system delivers roughly 10x voltage (vs. 48V DC) in cables 1/10th the thickness, reducing copper use, construction costs, and carbon footprint while adding fault detection that disables power before shock/fire hazards injure technicians.

## Why it matters

Class 4 is the first new power class since 1978; Ibrahim served on the CSA working group updating electrical code. For electrical contractors and data center builders, the dramatic reduction in copper thickness and mass addresses pathways/conduit constraints and material costs in high-density deployments. The integrated fault-managed safety model also protects non-electrician telecom technicians working on live systems.

**Evidence from source:**

- Class 4 power systems are the first new class introduced since 1978; Ibrahim is a member of the CSA working group updating electrical code.
- System delivers roughly 10x the voltage (vs. 48V DC) in a cable that is 1/10th the thickness, requiring less copper than traditional AC.
- Fault-managed DC power systems can detect faults causing shock/fire hazards and disable itself before technician injury.

## Open questions

- What are the AHJ approval timelines and inspector training requirements for Class 4 installations in major data center markets?
- How does the fault detection integrate with existing DCIM or BMS monitoring platforms?
