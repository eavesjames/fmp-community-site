## What it is

Article explains NYC's building electrification strategy under Local Law 97, which sets strict carbon emission limits for large buildings starting 2024 with tighter thresholds in 2030. Highlights replacement of fossil fuel systems with electric heat pumps, water heating, and cooking, plus upgraded electrical panels and smart controls.

## Why it matters

NYC buildings (70% of city emissions) face financial penalties if they exceed carbon intensity limits. Property owners must evaluate electrification retrofits that require upgraded electrical panels and service infrastructure, particularly as 2030 compliance thresholds are significantly tighter than 2024 baseline.

**Evidence from source:**

- Local Law 97 sets carbon emission limits for large buildings starting 2024, with stricter limits in 2030
- Buildings account for nearly 70 percent of NYC total emissions
- Electrification includes upgraded electrical panels and smart energy controls as part of fossil fuel system replacement

## Open questions

- What panel capacity and service upgrades are typically required to support heat pump and cooking electrification in existing NYC buildings?
- How are property owners sequencing LL97 electrification work given the 2024 vs 2030 compliance timeline?
