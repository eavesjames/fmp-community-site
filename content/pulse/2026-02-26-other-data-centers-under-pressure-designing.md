## What it is

The article addresses infrastructure design pressures in hyperscale data centers driven by AI workloads. It highlights that power density has increased to approximately 36 kW per rack, significantly exceeding traditional data center densities.

## Why it matters

The shift from traditional to 36 kW per rack densities represents a step-change constraint for facilities and electrical teams designing distribution systems, selecting cabling/busway, and coordinating cooling. This impacts both greenfield specifications and retrofit capacity assessments in existing hyperscale environments.

**Evidence from source:**

- Hyperscale data centers running large-scale AI workloads now see power density around 36 kW per rack
- 36 kW per rack is significantly above traditional data center rack densities

## Open questions

- What specific distribution architecture changes (busway vs. cable, breaker sizing) are operators adopting to support 36 kW racks?
- How are connector and pathway thermal limits being validated at these sustained power levels?
