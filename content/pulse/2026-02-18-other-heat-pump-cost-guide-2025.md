## What it is

Pricing guide for residential heat pump installations ranging $1,500-$30,000+ across mini-split, central air-source, and geothermal systems. Documents electrical infrastructure upgrade costs including panel upgrades ($1,500-$3,000) and complete service upgrades ($2,500-$5,000) required for electrification retrofits. Includes federal tax credit details (30% up to $2,000 for air-source) and regional cost variations.

## Why it matters

Electrical service and panel upgrades represent hidden but mandatory costs for heat pump retrofits, directly impacting contractor scoping and homeowner decision-making. For electrical contractors, understanding the $1,500-$5,000 service upgrade requirement helps accurate bidding on electrification projects. Cold-climate deployments command 20-40% premiums, signaling higher electrical infrastructure demands in northern retrofit markets.

**Evidence from source:**

- Panel upgrade (100 to 200 amp): $1,500-$3,000; Complete electrical service upgrade: $2,500-$5,000
- Cold-climate heat pumps cost 20-40% premium over standard systems
- Federal 30% tax credit up to $2,000 for air-source systems; combined state rebates reduce costs by $2,000-$12,000

## Open questions

- What percentage of residential heat pump installs require panel or service upgrades vs. adequate existing capacity?
- How do permit/AHJ timelines for electrical service upgrades affect heat pump project schedules in retrofit scenarios?
