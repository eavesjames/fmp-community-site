## About This Site

This is a community-driven knowledge base for **Fault Managed Power (FMP)** technology, also known as Class 4 power distribution. We aggregate updates from industry leaders, provide practical resources, and help practitioners understand when and how to deploy FMP.

### What You'll Find Here

- **[Pulse](/pulse/)**: Daily updates from VoltServer, Panduit, Cisco, and the FMP Alliance
- **[Topics](/topics/)**: Deep dives into key FMP concepts (safety model, estimating, scheduling)
- **[Players](/players/)**: Profiles of organizations advancing FMP technology
- **[Library](/library/)**: Calculators, templates, and technical resources
- **[Glossary](/glossary/)**: Clear definitions of FMP terminology

### Three Frictions We Address

1. **Decision friction**: When does FMP make sense vs. conventional AC distribution?
2. **Estimating friction**: How to price and compare FMP installations
3. **Coordination friction**: How to spec, communicate, and deploy across stakeholders
