## About this site

**faultmanagedpower.org** is both a resource on Fault Managed Power and an experiment in using multi-agent AI, structured knowledge design, and automation to organize information in emerging technical fields.

The goal is to make fragmented information more useful without letting AI blur the line between grounded claims and speculation.
